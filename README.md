## 🧠 Core Concepts

This project includes:

### 📊 Data Exploration
- Examine distributions of key features (budget, genre, cast popularity)
- Visualize relationships between variables and revenue

### 🔧 Feature Engineering
Create meaningful predictors such as:
- Genre encoding
- Budget scaling
- Temporal features (e.g., release month, holiday effects)

### 🤖 Machine Learning Models
Train and compare models such as:
- Linear Regression
- Random Forest Regressor
- Gradient Boosting Machines
- XGBoost / LightGBM (optional)

### 🧪 Evaluation
- RMSE / MAE metrics
- Cross-validation scores
- Model comparison plots
